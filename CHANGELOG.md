Our combined changelog and roadmap. It contains todos as well as dones.

Items can be optionally be tagged tagged by GitHub owner issue if discussion
happened / is needed.

Please add your entries in this format:

 - `- [ ] (<plugin name>|website|core|meta|build|test): <Present tense verb> <subject> \(<list of associated owners/gh-issues>\)`.

Following [SemVer spec item 4](http://semver.org/#spec-item-4),
we're `<1.0.0` and allowing ourselves to make breaking changes in minor
and patch levels.

In the current stage we aim to release a new version on the
first Friday of every new month.

## Backlog

Ideas that will be planned and find their way into a release at one point

- [ ] build: browsersync does 3 refreshes, can that be one? should be doable via cooldown/debounce?
- [ ] build: go over `package.json` togeteher and clean up npm run scripts (@arturi, @hedgerh, @kvz)
- [ ] build: investigate Rollup someday, for tree-shaking and smaller dist https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/1379#issuecomment-183383199, https://github.com/nolanlawson/rollupify
- [ ] build: revisit sourcemaps for production. can we have them without a mandatory extra request?
- [ ] core: Decouple rendering from Plugins and try to make Uppy work with React (add basic example) to remain aware of possible issues (@hedgerh), look at https://github.com/akiran/react-slick
- [ ] core: test with real screen reader to identify accessibility problems
- [ ] core: Make sure Uppy works well in VR
- [ ] instagram: Add basic Instagram plugin example (#21)
- [ ] presets: Add basic preset that mimics Transloadit's jQuery plugin (#28)
- [ ] test: checkout http://www.webpagetest.org, use it sometimes to test our website & Uppy?
- [ ] test: setup an HTML page with all sorts of crazy styles, resets & bootstrap to see what brakes Uppy (@arturi)
- [ ] website: Make a gif/video of Uppy Modal or DragDrop demo (drag & drop a few files -> upload happens)

## 0.0.5

Theme: Acceptance tests and Google Drive Polish

Scheduled to be released: May 06, 2016

- [ ] Wire saucelabs and travis togeteher, make saucelabsl fails fatal to travis builds
- [x] Add `addFile`-hack so we can have acceptance tests on Safari as well as Edge (@arturi)
- [x] drive: possible UI polish (@hedgerh)
- [x] drive: write files to filesystem correctly (@hedgerh)
- [x] test: Fix 15s timeout image.jpg (@arturi)
- [x] test: Sign up for Browserstack.com Live account so we can check ourselves what gives and verify saucelabs isn't to blame (@arturi) <-- Turns out, Saucelabs already does that for us
- [x] test: Get tests to pass Latest version of Internet Explorer (Windows 10), Safari (OSX), Firefox (Linux), Opera (Windows 10) (@arturi) <-- IE 10, Chrome, Firefox on Windows and Linux, but not Safari and Microsoft Edge — Selenium issues
- [x] test: Get saucelabs to show what gives (errors, screenshots, anything) (@arturi)
- [x] build: sourcemaps for local development (@arturi) <-- Not adding it in production to save the extra request. For local dev, this was added already via Browserify
- [x] core: Add polyfill for `fetch` (@hedgerh)
- [x] core: Apply plugins when DOM elements aren't static (#25)
- [x] core: figure out the shelf thing https://transloadit.slack.com/archives/uppy/p1460054834000504 https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ypx6a0a82s65o0z/2016-04-08%20at%2010.38.png (@arturi, @hedgerh)
- [x] core: reduce the monstrous 157.74Kb prebuilt bundle footprint https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ypx6a0a82s65o0z/2016-04-08%20at%2010.38.png <-- we see no way to optimize at this stage
- [x] drive: add breadcrumb navigation (@hedgerh)

- [x] modal: Avoid duplicating event listeners <-- deprecated by yoyo
- [x] progressbar: make it great again (@arturi)
- [x] progressdrawer: figure out why the whole list is replaced with every update (dom diff problems) (@arturi)
- [x] test: Let Travis use the Remote WebDriver instead of the Firefox WebDriver (https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/gui-and-headless-browsers/#Using-Sauce-Labs), so Saucelabs can run our acceptance tests against a bunch of real browsers. Local acceptance tests keep using Firefox <-- need to add command to Travis (@arturi)
- [x] test: Move failing multipart test back from `v0.0.5` dir, make it pass (@arturi)
- [x] tus: Add support tus 1.0 uploading capabilities (#3) <-- works!
