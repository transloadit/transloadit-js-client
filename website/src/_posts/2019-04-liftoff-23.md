Hello and welcome to Day 23 of our '30 Days to Liftoff' blog post challenge. The launch date for **Uppy 1.0** is still set for **April the 25th** and a lot of work is ongoing to make it happen. Let's take a look at the updates for today!

- About 10 months ago, the Uppy team had to remove locales from Uppy. [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) and [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz) finished up the implementation on [language packs](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1443) such that you can now display Uppy in your local Language. Here is a quick example on how it is intended for use:

    ```

    const russianLocale = require('@uppy/locales/lib/ru_RU')
    const uppy = Uppy({
    locale: russianLocale,
    })

    ```
The Uppy team also encourages members of the community to submit a write and Pull request for locales which has not yet been supported.

- [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) made a few tweaks [here](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1452) and continues working on the website.

- [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) continues investigating incorrect progress reporting / uploads with XHR and Companion.

- [Ren√©e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) is working on error reporting for the Transloadit plugin as mentioned yesterday, which notifies us of certain connection problems when they occur.

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) continues her work on browser compatibility for url drops and pastes.

On that note, Day 23 of our thirty-day challenge comes to an end. Tomorrow looks like it will be another exciting day, so don't hesitate to keep checking up on us via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) or [RSS](https://uppy.io/atom.xml)!
