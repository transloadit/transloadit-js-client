With Easter behind us only two days remain for our **Uppy 1.0 release on the 25th**. We hope you're anticipating the release as much as we're anticipating a well deserved break!

In terms of progress and completed features things are looking good. The entire team isn't present today due to personal holidays and other commitments but there's no slowing down as we approach our deadline!

- The [Russian language pack](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1467) for Uppy was added by [Artur](https://github.com/arturi). [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) and Evgenia have been weighing in with some feedback of their own to help get it completed. Feel free to contibute if you know Russian!

- [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) fixed an issue involving the Transloadit API responding successfully before the upload is complete. This occurred when using XHR for uploading. Now when using Companion there will be a check for any mismatch in bytes from an uploaded file to ensure this does not happen.

- The [illusive upload progress](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1454) for multipart downloads feature added by Ife was also successfully tested by Artur.

- [Artur's](https://github.com/arturi) contributions didn't end there! He also updated our [React Native example](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1469) to use Uppy 0.30.5.

- We had a bit of an issue after releasing Uppy 0.30.5 which involved [404 errors being thrown](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1466) for certain 0.30.5 specific CSS and JS files. This was an issue regarding one of our CDN scripts which was aptly fixed by [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz).

- [Abdel](https://github.com/kiloreux) is creating the French language pack for Uppy, and is considering working on an Arabic one for post 1.0 updates.

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) has continued her work on [accessibility issues with Uppy's provider views](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/created_by/nqst) and is planning on adding her improvements in the coming days.

Don't forget that today is Day 29 of our '30 Days to Liftoff' challenge. With **Uppy 1.0** on its way and our blog post challenge coming to an end we hope you won't miss these quick updates too much!
