Hi there, welcome to the fifteenth day in our '30 Days to Liftoff' blog post challenge. Happy to have you here, as the Uppy team is moving closer towards **launching Uppy 1.0 on April 25**. Today is Tuesday, and we are lifting off from yesterdays motivation. As you know we are an agile team, we had our weekly call yesterday, and I can confirm that Uppy is closer than you expect.

Let's get the updates rolling!

## Project Board
Yesterday we had our weekly call, during this call, we re-evaluated our board, moved some cards to the `done` lane as well as moved some to the `in progress` lane. One feature coming up, which I am particularly interested in is the language pack. Uppy 1.0 is coming out in your local language! Although we have limited resources as about the language packs, we will support as many as we can and hope that the community picks up the rest. 

Here is a view of what our asana board looks like this week:

## Done

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) investigated an [issue](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1400#issuecomment-481039845) that had to do with a bug in Webkit browsers where the window was blinking frequently.

- [Samuel](https://github.com/samuelayo) added another Uppy [example](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1389) while using Uppy with PHP and xhr upload.


## In Progress

- [Ren√©e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) is working on `robodog.dashboard()` for resuable in-line dashboard

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) is working on improving accessibility together with Alex, who found many issues that we still need to fix in this area.

- [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) is currently working on a React Native example UI. We will update you once this UI is ready! 

- [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) keeps on working actively on design improvements for Uppy. You can follow his progress [here](https://github.com/nqst/uppy/commits/design-facelift)
