Today marks the eleventh day in our 30 Days to Liftoff! The weekend is upon us, however, a lot of work is still being done today.

## New

- [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) is test driving Uppy('s accessibility) in many different browsers and already uncovered [many issues](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/created_by/nqst) in some naughty browsers. Hope we'll manage to fix all of them before April 25!

## In Progress

- [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) is working on getting the changelog for Uppy v 0.30.4 out as soon as possible. More news about the 0.30.4 release in the "Done" section.

- Our React Native team (that's [Artur](https://github.com/arturi), [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju), and [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz)) have been pairing again and determined there are only a few things left to do:

    - add customFingerPrint & hashCode into Ife's tus-js-client branch, add tests, get it into shape for Marius to review
    - UI tweaks (close button for Import, reporting errors)
    - File preview icon for non-image files

- Non-React Native things that were discussed where:

  - Large file support
  - Companion XHR Uploads should report download progress towards client-side-reported upload progress
  - When you upload to api2.transloadit.com with XHR, it seems the API does not block and responds with 200 before the upload is really done (MAYBE :o). This results in a bad Uppy state without a progress bar

## Done

- We made a new Uppy release. While the release made isn’t 1.0, it is a step further to get to it. Uppy `0.30.4` features the `allowSyntheticImports` fix, Typescript typings fixes, using companion-client for remote aws-s3 uploads, and alongside React Native fixes for websockets and `console.dir` not being available there.

- Artur alongside [Renée](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) reviewed and merged a [PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1360) that allows a user to customize the status of an upload in Uppy. Thanks to [Mactavish](https://github.com/Mactaivsh) for contributing.

- [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz) finished up his work on the [new documentation menu structure](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1405) that we talked about [yesterday](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-10/).
