## In Progress

- [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) is working on getting the changelog for Uppy v 0.3.0 out as soon as possible. More news about the 0.3.0 release in the `done` section.

- [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) is working on some UI polishes, mostly based on some issues which he raised. We can find the issues [here](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1415) and [here](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1416)

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) is working on making sure the provider view grid/list check-boxes should be adjusted for easy accessibility.


## Done

- We made A new Uppy release. While the release made isn’t 1.0, it is a step further to get to 1.0. We present to you `uppy 0.30.4`, which features the `allowSyntheticImports` fix, Typescript typings fix, 
using companion-client for remote aws-s3 uploads, alongside other bug fixes.

- Artur alongside [Renée](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) reviewed and merged a [PR](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1360) that allows a user to customize the status of an upload in Uppy. Thanks to [Mactavish](https://github.com/Mactaivsh) for raising the PR.

- [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz) finished up his work on the [new documentation menu structure](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1405). 


 
That’s it. That’s all the updates I have for you today. The weekend is here, but best believe we will have something for you tomorrow. I’ll be expecting to have you here.
