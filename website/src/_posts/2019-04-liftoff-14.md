Today marks the fourteenth day in our 30 Days to Liftoff blogpost challenge, working our way towards launching Uppy 1.0 on **April 25**.

## Done

- [Ren√©e](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop) finished work on [cancelling Transloadit Assemblies](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1431) when you abort uploads.

- [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) and [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) delivered on the bare essentials for React Native. In our local tests, this means we can now successfully pick different files, have their uploads resume where they left off, select a remote/Companion file (just picking from URL from now), and see progress reported by Companion is doing. There is a basic UI, most of which is encapsulated in the example that we'll publish. We're refraining from building too much UI in our react native module, as we'll assume that developers building apps will want to exert full control and style everthing closely to their app, and would care most about an example, and access to the core functionality that gets them resumability and companion (making mobile uploads more reliable, and less draining on battery and data plans). While there still are things like picking file from Instagram to be implemented, we now know that all the lego bricks we need are present and do what they are supposed to, so it just becomes a matter of fleshing those integrations out (which we may or may not get to pre-1.0, we'll see!).

- Artur also published the [CHANGELOG for 0.30.4](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/845369f0e56b49ab51d4d01909dfdac6f60b1748), which was a bit more work to figure out now that the whole Transloadit team is pilling commits on `master` :scream: and we did a few smaller tasks like fixing an issue with our build scripts, and updating the Companion docs.

## In Progress

- [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) is working on improving the Uppy design (in the code) in his [`design-facelift` branch](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/compare/master...nqst:design-facelift).

- [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) is working on improving accessibility together with Alex, who found many issues that we still need to fix in this area.

- Now that the bare essentials of React Native work, [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) is making sure our local work finds a proper place in the tus-js-client (such as React Native compatible fingerprinting) and [Artur](https://github.com/arturi) hopes to find the time to tick off a few design goals to make for a better experience testingdriving our example, such as icons for files that are not images, and a close button for the select file screen.

- The whole team will do a call this afternoon to check out our roadmap and see where all we stand. Some new tasks where added on [Friday](/blog/2019/04/liftoff-11/).


That's it for Day 14. Tomorrow it will be Samuel's turn again to update you on our board and progress, so subscribe via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uppy_io) or [RSS]((https://uppy.io/atom.xml) and don't miss out on Day 15 :dog:
