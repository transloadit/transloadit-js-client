Today marks the fourth day of our ongoing thirty-day blog post challenge, giving you an overview of all progress building up to our **Uppy 1.0 release on April 25!**

<!--more-->

Our big coding speedrun towards for 1.0 starts April 1, so are are mostly busy with tying up lose ends, busting issues, and planning out our work.

## Done

We haven't even hit April 1st and the 'Done' section of the project dashboard is getting plenty of love! Today [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) finished designing a specialised header for visitors of [Uppy.io](https://uppy.io) and [Tus.io](https://tus.io) to receive a discount on [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com/) services :wink:

[Adbel](https://github.com/Kiloreux) started a dialogue with the team regarding [Docker secrets](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/138) relating to one of our [open issues](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1295). He decided that the best course of action was to follow the Kuburnetes [best practices](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#best-practices) and add a `Secret` resource to contain the environment variables.

## In Progress

One of the most exciting updates in terms of progress today was also contributed by [Alex](https://github.com/nqst) with his impressive pre-alpha sketch of a new homepage for [Uppy.io](https://uppy.io/). Despite only being a work in progress the entire team has been overjoyed with the quality of the design! Take a look below.

Taking a deeper look into some of the effort the team is putting in on the [Uppy repo](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pulls) shows that [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju) [focused on fixing hanging Instagram files uploaded via Companion](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1274/files).

Additionally, the content team's own [Samuel](https://github.com/samuelayo) has been hard at work updating and refining the Uppy examples, with the [first in the pipeline being Node.js and Flask](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1389) related. 

Day 4 complete! Catch up with us tomorrow for updates on Day 5 of our 30 Days to Liftoff! And of course if you want to keep yourself constantly updated feel free to subscribe to our [RSS feed](https://uppy.io/atom.xml).
