The entire team is starting to hit their groove as the Uppy channel in our Slack workspace is looking livelier than ever. So let's dive straight into Day 9 of our 30 Days to Liftoff!

Everyone is moving at a comfortable pace, working on the various *In Progress* cards sitting neatly on our Uppy board, so here's a quick update on the progress towards **Uppy 1.0, coming April 25**!


## Done

Tasks completed by the team since yesterdays update include:

- Our React Native team (that's [Renée](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop), [Artur](https://github.com/arturi), [Ife](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju), [Evgenia](https://github.com/lakesare) and [Kevin](https://github.com/kvz)) gave an update on the current completed features for implementing Uppy support. Here's a list of completed tasks directly from the team:
    - [x] Get a link provider example to work, including showing Companion progress and resumability
    - [x] Get its own UI, (re)written for RN
    - [x] Make websocket progress from Companion work (see: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network#websocket-support)
    - [x] Have an example with buttons for resumability & a progress bar
    - [x] Have resumability support within 20 min (easily tested by disabling WiFi on your workstation while uploading to master.tus.io)

- A [feature request](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1367) was submitted by [Andrew Shini](https://github.com/superandrew213) involving checking for existing uploads before uploading anything, which has been necessary for his custom dashboard. Artur and Renée will be reviewing it. A big thank you to the open source community for making contributions!

## In Progress

Meanwhile on the progress side of things:

- [Abdel](https://github.com/Kiloreux) has started working on a [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) demo involving Companion so users can have an even easier time utilising our services.

- [Tim](https://github.com/tim-kos) has started working on fixing an API problem which caused one of our end-to-end tests to be disabled. He's also started working on implementing a backend solution for the 20% discount coupon feature for [uppy.io](https://uppy.io/) and [tus.io](https://tus.io/) visitors coming to [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com/).

- Kevin started working on a new documentation structure for the site. We hope this will make documentation for your favourite Uppy features much easier to find.

- Finally, the React Native team has already completed an impressive amount of tasks but they aren't slowing down anytime soon. Development marches on as the team begins tackling the following tasks:
    - [ ] Add basic file preview to react native example. Can use `file.uri` for images, can use icons for `file.type===video/audio/document` (Artur Paikin)
    - [ ] Release Uppy (add inline customFingerPrint & AsyncStorage for now, we'll remove customFingerPrint later, once tus-js-client is in good shape) (Artur Paikin)
    - [ ] Test fingerprinting for Audio, Document (Artur Paikin)
    - [ ] Add customFingerPrint & hashCode into Ife's tus-js-client branch, add tests, get it into shape for Marius to review (Ifedapo Olarewaju)

On Thursday they'll be having a call to discuss their completed work so far and map out future tasks from there. Look forward to more details on this call in the future!

The first third of our 30 day challenge ends tomorrow with Day 10. Look forward to more updates (and pictures of dogs in space) tomorrow and, as usual, don't forget about our [RSS feed](https://uppy.io/atom.xml) :dog2:
